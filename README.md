# ETL Pipelines with Shell, Apache Airflow, and Kafka

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and manage ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines using Shell scripting, Apache Airflow, and Kafka. The focus is on creating reliable, scalable, and maintainable data pipelines that process data efficiently.

## Features

* **BashOperator in Airflow:** Automate ETL tasks using shell scripts within Apache Airflow DAGs.
* **PythonOperator in Airflow:** (Optional) Build ETL pipelines with Python tasks for better flexibility.
* **Kafka Streaming:** (Optional) Implement continuous data streaming pipelines using Apache Kafka.
* **Monitoring and Scheduling:** Use Airflow's UI to monitor and schedule data pipeline runs.
* **Best practices:** Handle task dependencies, retries, and logging in Airflow.

## Project Components

1. **Shell Scripts:** Scripts to perform data extraction, transformation, and loading.
2. **Apache Airflow DAGs:** Directed Acyclic Graphs that define the ETL workflows and task dependencies.
3. **Kafka Streaming:** Set up Kafka producers and consumers for real-time data processing.

## How to Run

1. Install Apache Airflow and Kafka (links to official docs).
2. Place the shell scripts and DAG files in the appropriate Airflow directories.
3. Configure Airflow to run your DAGs.
4. (Optional) Set up Kafka topics and run producer/consumer scripts for streaming.

## Results

* Successful execution of ETL pipelines triggered via Airflow UI.
* Real-time streaming data processed through Kafka topics.
* Logs and monitoring dashboards demonstrate pipeline health and performance.

## Technologies Used

* Apache Airflow
* Apache Kafka
* Bash scripting
* Python (for optional PythonOperator DAGs)

If you want, I can also help you write a detailed step-by-step guide or upload sample scripts for the repo. Would you like that?
